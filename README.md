  ## Description
  Here is an application that enables future employers to view my current works, and learn a little about me.

  ## Installation
  If the user intends to review my portfolio on their local machine, they will ensure that they have the approrpiate package name and versions already included inside     the package.json file, the user will then perform a npm install into their terminal. This will install all relevant dependencies.

  ## Usage
  AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
  SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
